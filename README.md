# dArkOS-G80CA-SE

**Customised dArkOS build optimized for G80CA / G80CA-MB devices**  
(RK3326-based R36S/RG351MP-style clones)

- This version of [dArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/dArkOS) is customised for the best experience on G80CA hardware.
- If you are looking for the pure [dArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/dArkOS) experience on the G80CA try [dArkOS-G80CA](https://github.com/southoz/dArkOS-G80CA)

The main differences from stock RG351MP builds are hardware-specific adjustments to make future updates and maintenance easier.  
The **only** component out of sync with upstream dArkOS is the **Battery LED Service** script due to the G80CA LED GPIOS and dual red/blue LED hardware.

## ⚠️ Important Installation Warnings

Before flashing — **very important** to avoid bricking or failed installs:

- **Do NOT** have the charger plugged in during the whole flashing & first-boot process
- **Remove the Second SD Card** if installed and wait until the installation is complete before re-inserting.
- The ArkOS Wiki recommends **avoiding Balena Etcher** for this device (many users report failures)

## Step-by-Step Installation

1. Download the latest image from:  
   → [Releases page](https://github.com/southoz/dArkOS-G80CA/releases)

2. Extract the `.img` file using **7-Zip** (or similar)

3. Verify the file integrity (recommended):  
   Compare the hash with the value published in the release notes

4. Flash the image to a good quality microSD card using one of these tools (all confirmed working):
   - USB Image Tool
   - Raspberry Pi Imager
   - Rufus (Windows)
   - **Avoid** Balena Etcher if possible

5. Insert the card (no second ROM card yet) → power on

6. First boot:  
   → Blue screen appears → device expands partitions → auto-reboots

7. Second boot:  
   → Blue screen again → expands `roms.tar` to EASYROMS partition → auto-reboots

8. Final boot → you should land in EmulationStation

### Adding ROMs on second SD card (optional)

- Power off completely
- Insert your ROMs SD card
- Boot the device
- Press **START** → **Options** → **Advanced** → **Switch to SD2 for Roms**

## 🎮 Controller / Key Mapping (SDL)

Buttons have been aligned as closely as possible to the **RG351MP** layout.  
Analogue tuning is not yet implemented.
